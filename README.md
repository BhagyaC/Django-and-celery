# Django-and-celery


### What is celery

**Celery is a task queue implementation for Python web applications used to asynchronously execute work outside the HTTP request-response cycle.**
This is the official definision for celery. In simple terms in your website a request goes for some result and if it take more time it will cause a time out error and instead of happening this we can engage the website some other manner and the processing of request will be done in the back ground without affecting any other process.

So before going into celery with django I suppose simple celery have to go first
